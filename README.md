# odin-recipes
This project will be to practice and apply my HTML knowledge
to create a basic recipe website. The website will consist of
a main index page with links to a few recipes. Once complete,
this will have demonstrated my abilities to apply paragraphs,
links and various other HTML formatting skills.
